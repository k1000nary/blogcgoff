		&lt;h2&gt;Essential things to think about before starting a blog&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;figure class="image illustration" style="float:right;"&gt;&lt;img alt="A picture of wooden spoons with spices and herbs in them." src="https://ckeditor.com/assets/images/bg/spoons.jpg" width="450px"/&gt;
			&lt;figcaption&gt;It takes several ingredients to create a delicious blog.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		&lt;/figure&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It has been exactly 3 years since I wrote my first blog series entitled “Flavorful Tuscany”, but starting it was definitely not easy. Back then, I didn’t know much about blogging, let alone think that one day it could become &lt;strong&gt;my full-time job&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though I had many recipes and food-related stories to tell, it never crossed my mind that I could be sharing them with the whole world&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I am now a &lt;strong&gt;full-time blogger&lt;/strong&gt; and the curator of the &lt;a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/#"&gt;Simply delicious newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, sharing stories about traveling and cooking, as well as tips on how to run a successful blog.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;If you are tempted by the idea of creating your own blog, please think about the following:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Your story (what do you want to tell your audience)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Your audience (who do you write for)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Your blog name and design&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After you get your head around these 3 essentials, all you have to do is grab your keyboard and the rest will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
